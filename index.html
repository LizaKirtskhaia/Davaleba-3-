        <h2>Glamping</h2>
        Glamping is a portmanteau of <i>"glamorous"</i> and <i>"camping"</i>, and 
        describes a style of camping with amenities and, in some cases,
        resort-style services not usually associated with "traditional"
        camping. Glamping has become particularly popular with 21st 
        century tourists seeking the luxuries of hotel accommodation
        alongside "the escapism and adventure recreation of camping"

        <h2>History</h2>
        The word "glamping" first appeared in the <strong>United Kingdom </strong>in 2005[5] and was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2016.[6] 
        The word is new, but the concept that "glamping" connotes, that of luxurious tent-living 
        (or living in other camping accommodations), is not. In the 16th century, the Scottish Earl of Atholl prepared a lavish experience in 
        the Highlands for the visiting King James V and his mother. Here, the Duke 
        pitched lavish tents and filled them with all the provisions of his own home palace
